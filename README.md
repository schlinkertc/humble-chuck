## About Me

**I’m a software developer and problem solver with a strong focus on
Python and data-driven solutions.** From building custom tools for data
visualization to optimizing real estate investment strategies with
complex calculations like levered IRR, I love finding creative,
efficient ways to tackle challenges. I have a deep interest in coding,
cloud technology, and real estate analytics, and I’m constantly learning
new ways to improve workflows and outcomes.

Outside of my work in tech, I’ve been a musician for most of my life. I
started playing drums at 9, studied jazz performance at NYU, and
co-founded the band Del Water Gap. I’ve performed with Maggie Rogers and
have been gigging in NYC since I was 16, balancing my passion for music
with my love for coding and problem-solving.

As a father to my 8-year-old son Jackson, co-parenting has been one of
my biggest and most rewarding challenges. It’s taught me how to navigate
both personal and professional responsibilities with focus and
flexibility.

## About Me

**I’m a software developer and problem solver with a strong focus on
Python and data-driven solutions.** From building custom tools for data
visualization to optimizing real estate investment strategies with
complex calculations like levered IRR, I love finding creative,
efficient ways to tackle challenges. I have a deep interest in coding,
cloud technology, and real estate analytics, and I’m constantly learning
new ways to improve workflows and outcomes.

Outside of my work in tech, I’m a lifelong musician. I studied jazz
performance at NYU, and co-founded the band Del Water Gap. I’ve
performed with Maggie Rogers and have been gigging in NYC since I was
16, balancing my passion for music with my love for coding and
problem-solving.

I’m particularly interested in open-source development and using
notebooks as a way to document my thought process. NBDev lets me iterate
quickly while keeping the codebase well organized.

**I made this site using NBDev**

## About the Code

This repository contains a collection of small modules that demonstrate
my approach to building reusable tools.

- `delegation` – share function parameters with a decorator
- `dependency` – lightweight dependency management with Pydantic
- `multi_enum` – enumerations with multiple aliases
- `database` – SQLAlchemy helpers configured via Pydantic models
- `display` – utilities for Plotly and Pydantic documentation
- `arc_gis` – simple wrappers around the ArcGIS API
- `baseball` – modeling responses from the MLB Stats API

Each module begins life in a notebook and is exported with nbdev,
providing an example of how I iterate on ideas and keep my code
organized.

    "\n",
    "Managing configuration in Python projects can often become disorganized, with scattered environment variables and configuration files leading to hard-to-trace bugs and security risks. My projects become scattered with redundant .env files that all need to be updated when a password changes. Copying and pasting something like an API key into an EXPORT command in a terminal feels clunky. Importing `os` and setting sensitive environment variables via `os.environ` in your source code defeats their very purpose! \n",
    "\n",
    "I want to be able to store my sensitive variables in a central location to be used in multiple projects with different sections for project-specific values. I want to optionally override these options if needed, set defaults, and apply validation and throw sensible errors for missing or mal-formed values. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The Goal**  \n",
    "A centralized configuration management system for Python applications, leveraging Pydanticâ€™s powerful Settings Management features. A module that allows you to easily manage and validate environment variables, API keys, database credentials, and other sensitive or configurable settings in a consistent and structured manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use a central .cfg file to store sensitve info in sections. Default file location will be in the home directory, but it can be optionally overridden. We'll have a parent object that will be instantiated with the file location that will pro\n",
